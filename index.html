          Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its display
          property to grid. This gives you the ability to use all the other
          properties associated with CSS Grid. In CSS Grid, the parent element
          is referred to as the container and its children are called items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply creating a grid element doesn't get you very far. You need to
          define the structure of the grid as well. To add some columns to the
          grid, use the grid-template-columns property on a grid container as
          demonstrated below: <br />
          <code>
            .container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 50px 50px; }
          </code>
          <br />
          The number of parameters given to the grid-template-columns property
          indicates the number of columns in the grid, and the value of each
          parameter indicates the width of each column.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can use absolute and relative units like px and em in CSS Grid to
          define the size of rows and columns. You can use these as well: fr:
          sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space, auto:
          sets the column or row to the width or height of its content
          automatically, %: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of
          its container.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far in the grids you have created, the columns have all been tight
          up against each other. Sometimes you want a gap in between the
          columns. To add a gap between the columns, use the grid -column-gap
          property like this:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container2">
        <p>This is container two I have to show a difference!</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  </body>
